# Recipe Central

## About
This is our group final project for the course CSC207H1: Software Design in the fall of 2023. 

Using our app, you can search for a bunch of recipes with the list of ingredients and a link to the instructions. You can also create custom cookbooks where you can store the recipes you like from the search results in them.

We use the Edamam API which has access to a database containing 2 million recipes and can search over a bunch of filters

## Installation & Running the app
All you need is Java with its base packages and the GSON packages.
Download the files into a folder, and run app.Main.java in any IDE.
